# Cooking recipe App

# Description

This project was built using ReactJs mainly. This project lists Korean and Japanese food alphabetically on the screen. When you click one of the listed foods, It will show the recipe spesifically to that food. For returning back to the listed foods, you can click the top left return icon '<' that looks like this.

이 프로젝트는 주로 ReactJs를 사용하여 구축되었습니다. 이 프로젝트는 화면에 한식과 일식을 알파벳순으로 나열합니다. 나열된 음식 중 하나를 클릭하면 해당 음식에 대한 레시피가 구체적으로 표시됩니다. 나열된 음식으로 돌아가려면 다음과 같은 왼쪽 상단의 반품 아이콘 '<'을 클릭하면됩니다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
